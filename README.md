# Instagram Clone

ðŸš€ Just launched my own Instagram clone built with React, Firebase, Firestore, and Zustand! ðŸ“¸

Check out the live version: [Instagram Clone](https://insta-clone-kappa-pearl.vercel.app/)

## Tool Significance

This project leverages the power of several modern web development tools:

- **React**: Provides a modular UI with its component-based architecture and efficient state management.
- **Firebase**: Simplifies backend tasks with services like authentication, hosting, and cloud functions.
- **Firestore**: Offers a real-time NoSQL database with advanced querying capabilities and real-time data synchronization.
- **Zustand**: Delivers lightweight state management for scalability and maintainability.

Together, these tools create a robust, real-time Instagram clone with a seamless user experience.
